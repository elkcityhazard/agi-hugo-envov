Traditional concrete foundations are well-suited for holding up the structure above them.  This doesn't make them perfect choices for new construction.  They do pose some problems for new home construction - especially **green home construction.**  Traditional concrete foundations can transfer moisture to your basement interior if drainage isn't properly set up during your construction.  

Additionally, traditional concrete foundations also have poor heat retention ability.   Insulated Concrete Form Foundations attempt to remedy this issue by providing insulation on both sides of the poured concrete foundation.  

Beyond foundations, ICF Foundations can also make excellent external walls as well.  The materials used are tightly assembled and very strong.  This can actually aid with indoor allergens as well.  Since spaces are smaller for air to pass, less physical foreign matter can enter your home.

One further reason to consider ICF foundations is that they are quiet.  If your property is near a high-traffic road, ICF foundations can reduce your interior noise level dramatically.  This, combined with energy efficiency, disaster resistance, and overall home comfort, make ICF an excellent choice for new home construction projects.

Insulated Concrete Form Foundations (ICF Foundations) have several advantages.  They offer nearly double the amount of compressive strength over traditional poured concrete.  They are also more disaster resistant than traditional foundations.  ICF Foundations are often used in hurricane prone areas because they can withstand excessive winds.  

Another advantage for Northern Michiganders is that ICF Foundations offer outstanding continous insulation.  This makes them less prone to summer warming and moisture and keeps your basement climatable in the winter.

ICF foundations also have a higher fire resistance than other foundations.  Additionally, ICF foundations are less prone to shifting and cracking because the forms add additional support for the foundation.

There are many different types of concrete stamping patterns, allowing you to choose a design that will match almost any home's exterior decor. A stamped concrete driveway can be an excellent addition to your home. Not only does it provide a practical way for visitors to park their cars, but it also adds curb appeal.

Stamped concrete is a decorative concrete that has different patterns imprinted on it. It is usually used for driveways or sidewalks, but you can also get it done at the entry of your store or on your patio. This type of paving is great for a number of reasons. One of the best parts about stamped concrete is that itâ€™s relatively cheap. Depending on the design, you may be able to do the work yourself and end up with a better product than if you hired someone to do it for you. Stamped concrete is also attractive and durable.

## Cobblestone & Decorative Stone | Traverse City MI

Cobblestone is a type of masonry that uses relatively small, irregularly shaped stones. Cobblestone was often used to pave streets and sidewalks. Cobblestone has been around for centuries; in Europe it was commonly used due to its excellent ability to drain water and the additional advantage of not building up ruts like dirt roads previously.

Today, cobblestone is still used but not as a primary road material. So what is it used for? As a leading installer of cobblestone and other decorative stone products for 20 of years, we get asked this question daily. The short answer is - it depends! Cobblestone can be used in many applications, but they are most often used today as a decorative accent. In some cases, they are even still used in road construction, although this is not common because they are very expensive to transport.

Cobblestone is a popular choice for outdoor home projects, from driveways to garden paths. It gives the home an old-world feel and makes the yard stand out. Cobblestone is also known as setts or Belgian block. Cobblestone is made when larger stones are cut in to smaller stones, but it's not a new concept. It has been used for centuries, from the Roman Empire to present day Europe. When it comes to choosing cobblestone for a project, there are a few things you'll want to consider before making your decision.

Absolutely Gorgeous Interiors can help you answer these questions and many more. We have experience installing and planning cobblestone projects and can help you determine if cobblestone is a good choic for your concrete installation project.

According to [Porch](https://porch.com/project-cost/cost-to-install-a-cobblestone-driveway "Cost of Cobblestone Drieway Installation"):

> For your project in zip code 49685 with these options, the cost to install a cobblestone driveway starts at $15.16-$20.89 per square foot. Your actual price will depend on job size, conditions, finish options you choose.

## Decorative Flatwork

Decorative flatwork can cost a little bit more up from but it's long term lifecycle cost is minimal compared to other mediums.  Not only can flatwork provide a dazzling appearance to your property, it is simply built to last.  
Concrete makes an attractive offer because of it's long lasting durability.  Also, since concrete can be cast in several different colors and patterns, it can be an excellent choice for property owners who want a custom look at a reduced cost.  

We cannot recommend enough the impact decorative flatwork will have on your property.  Concrete construction is benefiting from exciting new advancements in technology that allow greater depths of colors and textures.

## Hardscape Patio | Traverse City MI

One of the simplest and most affordable ways to make your yard more functional is to invest in a hardscape patio. A hardscape patio is essentially a concrete slab with a design imprinted on top. This design can be anything from closely-placed bricks to expansive patterns. Creating this type of patio requires little effort, time, or money - making it the perfect way to accentuate an outdoor space without breaking the bank.

The patio is the structure, and the hardscape are the critical pieces of landscape design that bring the patio to life. These are all the non-living elements that bring the patio to life. Those looking to add a hardscape patio addition need to also consider the impact of it. Although hardscape patios are very durable, typically softscapes, or all of the living elements, are integrated as well which adds additional accents to your hardscape patio.

Hardscape patios can be simple to very elaborate. We specialize in many types of hardscape patio construction. From simple slab concrete patios, to more complex water features, we can help you turn your outdoor area into one of your best living areas.

## Concrete Driveways | Traverse City MI

Concrete driveways are the most common type of driveway material. A concrete driveway is a great choice for anyone looking to achieve a smooth, uniform look with their driveway, as well as get an extremely durable surface. There are many different options when it comes to concrete driveways and they can vary greatly in price and design.

### Concrete Mixed With Aggregates | Traverse City MI

Concrete is a mixture of aggregates, either coarse or fine, with cement, water and other additives. The two main components of concrete are the aggregate which provides the bulk, strength and texture. There are three types of aggregates: natural, manufactured and by-products.

The composition of concrete varies depending on the proportion of each component. Aggregate makes up around 60% of concrete by weight. Aggregates can be natural or manufactured materials like sand, rock, gravel or recycled construction waste. Cement takes about 6-8% by weight in concrete. Cement is a binder that holds the whole mixture together and allows it to harden. Water usually takes around 10% of the mix, but this amount can differ depending on the project, as well as climate and any other additives.

### Concrete With Custom Stenciled Designs | Traverse City MI

A popular option for those who want to add some uniqueness to their concrete driveways. Stencils are used to imprint designs when the concrete is partially dried but not all of the way. There are a lot of ways to spruce up the concrete in your home. There are many styles and designs that you can use, but one thing that will make any design stand out is custom stenciling. You can add an extra touch to your cement floors with simple stencils and paint. This will give you the opportunity to truly customize your home in a unique way, making it unique from anyone elses.

### Slate-Styled Concrete | Traverse City MI

Similar to a stenciled concrete design, slate-stenciled concrete is stamped with slate-textured mats before fulling setting. This will give you the best appereance if you are trying to mimic slate. The reason why homeowners might want to go this route is because slate is expensive and brittle which makes it a less ideal candidate for driveways. Using a slate-styled concrete method will give you the beautiful look of slate but without the maintenance and durability concerns associated with slate.

### Permeable Pavers | Traverse City MI

A newer solution out there is using a permeable plastic paver which some feel is a superior option. This technology is filled with different types of medium to create a hybrid of traditional paver and concrete that is very durable. Additionally, these are usually made of 100% recycled plastics which makes them friendly for the environment. The advantage of a permeable solution: the pavers lock in the aggregates and prevent them from taking on wear and damage.
