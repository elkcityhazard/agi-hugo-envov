## Make The Bathroom Space Feel Larger Than It Is  

Not all bathrooms were built with design, ergonomics, and functionality in mind. If your home is older, you may have a smaller bathroom that feels claustrophobic. Remodeling not only makes it look like new again but improves its usability as well! We can help with simple changes such as installing a smaller walk-in shower versus a large spacing-consuming bath tub. Many smaller bathrooms have large, dated vanities and one thing to consider is replacing these large, out-dated vanities with smaller modern pedestal sinks.

[Houzz](https://www.houzz.com/magazine/12-ways-to-make-any-bathroom-look-bigger-stsetivw-vs~84997339) has some great tips on maximizing a smaller bathroom and giving it a greater sense of space. Using white can add the perception that the bathroom is larger than it is. White reflects light and also naturally subsides which adds space to the room. Since many fixutures in the bathroom are white, this is a natural choice to increase the perceived space. 

Adding additional textures in the bathroom will can help break up the white tones and give the eye some additional energy to take in. Moldings, trim, and textures tile can aid in this to add variety.  

A floating vanity can help increase your sense of space especially if storage cannot be sacrificed. Having additional room below the vanity will help add a layer of space when moving around. Additionally, if you love your [tile work](https:///services/traverse-city-flooring-contractor/), a floating vanity is an excellent way to showcase it. Why hide that beautiful tile work when you can show it off? Floating vanities are also great for the entire family. Perhaps you have a toddler, or an elderly loved one. Having a floating vanity means you can easily to store a small step stool, walker, or wheelchair to accommodate everyone and to aid in creating a barrier free environment.  

## Remodeling Your Home Bathroom With Accessibility In Mind Is An Excellent Investment

When remodeling your bathroom, it is important to remember the aging and disabled population. Sometimes, older bathroom designs present accessibility challenges that make it difficult for seniors or those with disabilities to move around and enjoy their bathroom space. A bathroom remodel is a great chance to make your home more accessible for a person with limited mobility. For example, installing roll-in showers or wider hallways can help people with disabilities navigate your house without assistance. When you remodel your bathroom, don't forget about the smaller details that can have a big impact on someone who has trouble getting around.  

The ADA standards for showers are those that ensure accessibility for individuals with disabilities. These regulations include proper spacing, measurements and other requirements. For example, a shower that is compliant with the ADA must have a ramp or chair installed in case someone needs to sit down while taking a shower. This ramp should be at least 36“ x 36“. There should be a seat placed along the entire length of the area directly opposite of the shower controls to ensure proper ADA compliance.  

According to a [sfgate.com](https://homeguides.sfgate.com/costs-constructing-handicappedaccessible-bathroom-106254.html) article, 

> The material costs for refurbishing a conventional 100-square-foot
> household bathroom are typically $8,000 to $10,000 -- this includes a
> new shower, vanity cabinet with sink, toilet and tile flooring. You
> can expect to spend at least $2,000 to $3,000 more for
> handicapped-accessible bathroom components, but the expense can
> escalate substantially if you require costlier options such as a
> walk-in bathtub and a wider entry door to accommodate larger
> wheelchairs. All figures are based on 2015 dollars.  

A well-designed bathroom can be a sanctuary. More than just a room for grooming, your bathroom is an important space that supports healthy living. With the right design, it can function as a private retreat for relaxing and rejuvenating.

If you’re remodeling your home or looking to build a new one, accessibility should be a top consideration. An accessible bathroom makes life easier for people with disabilities and seniors. It also makes sense from an economic perspective, because it can help you avoid costly future renovations.  

## A remodeled bathroom can raise the value of your home and make it more attractive

Your home's bathroom is more than just a place to take care of your personal hygiene. It can have an effect on the overall value of your home and help you sell it faster, because buyers always look for attractive homes with well-kept bathrooms.  

According to a [zillow.com](https://www.zillow.com/sellers-guide/roi-for-bathroom-remodel/) study, bathrooms can positively affect your home selling price.  

-   National average ROI: 70.1 percent
-   National average cost: $19,134
- National average return: $13,422  

In addition to making your home more beautiful, bathroom remodels can add a lot of value to your home. Remodeling your bathroom can be a great investment. A nicely remodeled bathroom can not only improve your quality of life, but it can also add value and appeal to your home.

If you are planning to sell your home, consider what buyers look for when they are searching for a home.  Buyers tend to pay attention to the bathrooms in the house. This is the room that people use often, so if it’s nice, clean and well designed, it can make your rooms look nicer and attract more buyers.

## A Remodeled Bathroom Can Save Energy and Resources  

Older bathrooms can make a tremendous amount of water waste. That's why it's important to save water where possible.

A remodeled bathroom can save energy and resources in your home! From leaky faucets that waste water to inefficient toilets, old bathrooms are usually much less efficient than their newer counterparts. A new toilet, for example, can save up to 9,000 gallons of water per year. And the majority of the water used in homes goes towards showers and baths, which can be reduced by 50% when installing low-flow shower heads or a power shower head.  

According to the American Water Works Association, homes use an average of 52 gallons daily for showers and other household uses. The good news is that by upgrading to low-flow shower heads or a power shower head, you can save up to 30 gallons of water a day, or about 500 gallons per month.  

Furthermore, LED lights can save energy and money as well. LEDs can save 80% of the energy of incandescent bulbs and 50% of energy of fluorescent bulbs. For your money, LEDs can last 20 times longer, require up to 90% less electricity, and produce 90% less heat.  

Radiant floor heating in your bathroom can help you efficiently keep your bathroom warm and keep some of your hard earned dollars. Radiant floor heating is an efficient form of heating. This type of heating system uses a radiant heat source embedded in the flooring to warm your bathroom floor, walls and ceiling, unlike conventional heating systems which use air. Since heat rises to the top, and no one spends their time on the ceiling, radiant flooring can be a more efficient option to heat your bathroom and save you some money.
